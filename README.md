# TODO

- Git hooks: add `crystal tool format`
- Find out where to host the documentation. (_Review this in a few months._)
- When libraries are installed from Git repositories, the repository is expected to have version tags following a semver-like format, prefixed with a v. Examples: v1.2.3, v2.0.0-rc1 or v2017.04.1
